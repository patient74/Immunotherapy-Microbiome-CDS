## 1. Microbiome Diversity & Composition Profile

**SECTION 1: Microbiome Diversity & Composition Profile**

**Part 1 — Diversity characterization**

The patient's alpha diversity, characterized by the Shannon Diversity Index of 2.7, indicates a relatively high level of microbial diversity within the gut microbiome. This level of diversity has been associated with favorable outcomes in patients receiving anti-programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1) therapy for cancer, including Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma. For instance, studies have shown that a higher Shannon index is linked to better responses to immunotherapy (McCulloch et al., Nat Med 2022). The Simpson Diversity Index of 0.82 further supports this finding, as higher values generally correlate with greater diversity. The observed species count of 164 also reflects a diverse microbial community. The presence of a high number of observed species, particularly when combined with a high Shannon index, is often considered a marker of a healthy or robust microbiome, which can be associated with improved immune function and potentially enhanced response to immunotherapies like Axicabtagene ciloleucel (CAR-T).

**Part 2 — Taxa characterization**

The patient's gut microbiome composition includes several taxa that have been investigated for their potential role in modulating antitumor immune responses to immunotherapy. Notably, Akkermansia muciniphila, Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, and Bifidobacterium spp. have been identified in preclinical studies and clinical cohorts as potentially enhancing the efficacy of anti-PD-1 therapies (Cullin et al., Cancer Cell 2021; Matson et al., Science 2018). Furthermore, the presence of certain bacteria within the Lachnospiraceae and Ruminococcaceae families, specifically Lachnospiraceae spp. and Streptococcaceae spp., has been associated with favorable clinical outcomes in melanoma patients treated with anti-PD-1 therapy (McCulloch et al., Nat Med 2022). Conversely, Gram-negative bacteria, including members of the Proteobacteria phylum such as E. coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae, have been linked to an inflammatory host intestinal gene signature and unfavorable outcomes in similar patient populations (McCulloch et al., Nat Med 2022). The observed relative abundance of taxa like Ruminococcaceae (9.2%) and Bacteroides spp. (including Bacteroides Eggerthii and Bacteroides Uniformis) also aligns with findings suggesting that certain bacterial groups can influence immunotherapy response (Cullin et al., Cancer Cell 2021; Matson et al., Science 2018). The presence of Enterococcus faecalis and Blautia spp. has also been noted in studies exploring the microbiome's interaction with immunotherapy (Matson et al., Science 2018). These specific taxa represent a subset of the patient's microbiome composition that has been implicated in the context of antitumor immunity and immunotherapy response in previous research.


## 2. Metabolite Landscape

**SECTION 2: Metabolite Landscape**

The patient's metabolite profile provides insights into the gut microbiome's influence on antitumor immunity, potentially relevant to the planned CAR-T therapy.

**Short-Chain Fatty Acids (SCFAs):**
The patient's metabolite data reveals levels of 15.8 μM butyrate, 11.2 μM propionate, and 38.4 μM acetate. These SCFAs are produced by gut bacteria and are known to influence host immunity. Specifically, butyrate, a major SCFA, has been shown to directly modulate antitumor CD8+ T cell responses and improve chemotherapy efficacy through ID2-dependent IL-12 signaling (He et al., 2021). This mechanism suggests that butyrate can enhance the patient's immune response against the lymphoma. The levels of propionate and acetate, while also produced by gut bacteria, are less directly implicated in this specific antitumor immune pathway according to the provided evidence.

**Bile Acids:**
Analysis of bile acids is available for this patient, but the specific quantitative levels are not provided in the patient data. While bile acids are known to play roles in various physiological processes, including immune modulation, the provided evidence does not discuss the specific impact of bile acids on antitumor immunity or their potential interaction with CAR-T therapy. Therefore, based solely on the retrieved evidence, no specific interpretation can be made regarding the patient's bile acid levels in the context of immune function or treatment response.

The observed levels of butyrate, propionate, and acetate, particularly the butyrate level, may represent a potential factor influencing the patient's antitumor immune response and potentially the efficacy of subsequent therapies, including CAR-T. Further investigation into the specific contribution of these metabolites, especially butyrate, to the patient's immune profile is warranted.


## 3. Microbiome–ACT Interaction Outlook

**SECTION 3: Microbiome–ACT Interaction Outlook**

The patient is planned for autologous CAR-T cell therapy targeting CD19 for diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, Stage IV. The planned therapy involves Axicabtagene ciloleucel (CAR-T), which carries a moderate-high risk of cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and moderate risk of neurotoxicity. The patient has a second-line history. The patient's baseline microbiome profile, characterized by a Shannon index of 2.7 and a Simpson index of 0.82, with key taxa including Ruminococcaceae, Lachnospiraceae, Proteobacteria, E. Coli, and Blautia Spp., is relevant to understanding potential outcomes.

**Part 1 — Overall microbiome-ACT context**

The evidence suggests that alterations in the intestinal microbiome composition are associated with clinical outcomes following anti-CD19 CAR-T cell therapy in patients with B-cell malignancies. Studies in ACT cohorts have found associations between microbiome changes and CAR-T cell response, toxicity, and survival. For instance, retrospective cohort studies have linked exposure to antibiotics, particularly broad-spectrum agents like piperacillin/tazobactam, meropenem, and imipenem/cilastatin, before CAR-T cell infusion with worse survival and increased neurotoxicity (Smith et al., Nat Med 2022; Stein-Thoeringer et al., Nat Med 2023). Furthermore, studies have demonstrated that baseline microbiome alterations, including changes in alpha-diversity and specific microbial taxa, are associated with clinical outcomes after CAR-T cell therapy (Smith et al., Nat Med 2022; Stein-Thoeringer et al., Nat Med 2023). These findings indicate that the gut microbiome can influence the efficacy and safety profile of CAR-T cell immunotherapy in B-cell malignancies.

**Part 2 — Efficacy-related taxa**

Several specific microbial taxa have been linked to CAR-T cell therapy outcomes in ACT cohorts. Evidence indicates that higher abundance of the genus Ruminococcus was associated with an increased odds of Day 100 complete response (CR) (Smith et al., Nat Med 2022). Similarly, higher relative abundance of the genus Bacteroides was associated with Day 100 CR (Smith et al., Nat Med 2022). The genus Faecalibacterium, including the species Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, has also been associated with improved response to CD19 CAR T cell therapy (Smith et al., Nat Med 2022; Stein-Thoeringer et al., Nat Med 2023). Analysis of the class Clostridia, including genera Ruminococcus and Faecalibacterium, family Ruminococcaceae, and species Faecalibacterium prausnitzii and Ruminococcus bromii, was associated with Day 100 CR (Smith et al., Nat Med 2022). Additionally, the genus Akkermansia was found to be the top enriched dominant taxa in patients who achieved Day 100 CR (Smith et al., Nat Med 2022). The genus Enterococcus has also been associated with improved response to immune checkpoint blockade therapy (Smith et al., Nat Med 2022). These associations suggest that specific microbial taxa may play a role in mediating the anti-tumor efficacy of CAR-T cells.

**Part 3 — Toxicity-related taxa and metabolites**

The evidence also links specific microbial taxa and metabolites to the risk of CAR-T cell-associated toxicities, such as CRS and immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS). Higher abundance of the genus Ruminococcus was associated with an increased odds of Day 100 CR (Smith et al., Nat Med 2022). Higher abundance of the genus Bacteroides was associated with Day 100 CR (Smith et al., Nat Med 2022). The genus Faecalibacterium, including the species Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, has been associated with improved response to CD19 CAR T cell therapy (Smith et al., Nat Med 2022; Stein-Thoeringer et al., Nat Med 2023). The genus Akkermansia was also associated with pre-infusion peripheral T cell levels in these patients (Stein-Thoeringer et al., Nat Med 2023). Furthermore, the genus Enterococcus has been associated with decreased toxicity to immune checkpoint blockade therapy (Smith et al., Nat Med 2022). The genus Ruminococcus, Bacteroides, and Faecalibacterium were associated with Day 100 CR in the untargeted LEfSe analysis (Smith et al., Nat Med 2022). The genus Akkermansia was the top enriched dominant taxa in these patients (Smith et al., Nat Med 2022). These findings suggest that certain microbial taxa may influence the risk of CAR-T cell-associated toxicities.

**Part 4 — Metabolite context for T-cell function**

The evidence indicates that microbiota-derived metabolites, particularly short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), can modulate T-cell function in the context of CAR-T cell therapy. Metagenomic shotgun sequencing of fecal samples revealed pathway enrichment for peptidoglycan biosynthesis (peptidoglycan biosynthesis IV Enterococcus faecium (PWY 6471)) in patients who achieved Day 100 CR (Smith et al., Nat Med 2022). This suggests a potential role for metabolites produced by bacteria, such as Enterococcus, in influencing T-cell function. The genus Ruminococcus was associated with an increased odds of Day 100 CR (Smith et al., Nat Med 2022). The genus Bacteroides was associated with Day 100 CR (Smith et al., Nat Med 2022). The genus Faecalibacterium, including the species Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, has been associated with improved response to immune checkpoint therapy (Smith et al., Nat Med 2022; Stein-Thoeringer et al., Nat Med 2023). The genus Akkermansia was associated with pre-infusion peripheral T cell levels in these patients (Stein-Thoeringer et al., Nat Med 2023). These findings suggest that specific microbial taxa and their associated metabolites may play a role in modulating T-cell function and influencing the response to CAR-T cell therapy.



## 4. Confounding Factors

**SECTION 4: Confounding Factors**

**Antibiotic Exposure:**
The patient received Levofloxacin, a fluoroquinolone, from January 25, 2026, to February 5, 2026, and Piperacillin-tazobactam, a beta-lactam, from December 18, 2025, to December 27, 2025, both prior to the initiation of the planned immunotherapy. Evidence suggests that prior exposure to broad-spectrum antibiotics, such as piperacillin-tazobactam and meropenem, can alter the intestinal microbiome composition (Smith et al., Nat Med 2022; Stein-Thoeringer et al., Nat Med 2023). Studies indicate that these antibiotics can lead to dysbiosis, characterized by reduced abundances of certain bacterial groups, including Roseburia, Bifidobacterium, and Ruminococcus (Stein-Thoeringer et al., Nat Med 2023). Furthermore, antibiotic exposure has been associated with increased abundances of other bacterial groups, such as Enterococcus, Streptococcus, and Klebsiella (Stein-Thoeringer et al., Nat Med 2023). These changes in microbial composition may potentially impact the efficacy of cancer immunotherapies like CAR-T cell therapy, possibly by disrupting microbiome features that are otherwise associated with immunotherapy outcomes (Stein-Thoeringer et al., Nat Med 2023).

**PPI Use:**
The patient's medication list does not include Proton Pump Inhibitors (PPIs). Therefore, based on the provided evidence, there is no information regarding the potential effects of PPI use on the microbiome in the context of CAR-T cell immunotherapy.

**Prior Treatments:**
The patient has received prior chemotherapy regimens including R-CHOP, R-ICE, and Gemcitabine. Evidence indicates that prior chemotherapy treatments can also influence the gut microbiome composition (Smith et al., Nat Med 2022). For instance, exposure to antibiotics before CAR-T cell therapy has been linked to altered microbial communities (Smith et al., Nat Med 2022). While the specific impact of R-CHOP, R-ICE, or Gemcitabine on the microbiome in the context of subsequent CAR-T cell therapy is not detailed in the provided evidence, prior chemotherapy is recognized as a potential confounding factor that can affect microbiome-immunotherapy interactions (Smith et al., Nat Med 2022).

**Comorbidities:**
The patient has comorbidities including hypertension, hyperlipidemia, Type 2 diabetes, and chronic back pain. The provided evidence does not directly link these specific comorbidities to microbiome-immunotherapy interactions (Stein-Thoeringer et al., Nat Med 2023; Smith et al., Nat Med 2022). Therefore, based on the available data, these comorbidities are not considered significant confounding factors in this specific context.

No significant confounding factors with established microbiome-immunotherapy interactions were identified in the available data.


## 5. Microbiota-Modulation Intervention Considerations

**SECTION 5: Microbiota-Modulation Intervention Considerations**

**Dietary and Prebiotic Approaches**

Dietary and prebiotic approaches, including postbiotics and specific dietary fibers, have been investigated for their potential to modulate the gut microbiome and enhance the efficacy of anti-PD-1 immunotherapy in cancer models. Evidence suggests that certain postbiotics, such as exopolysaccharides (EPS) and cell-free supernatants (CFS) from bacteria like Lactobacillus and Faecalibacterium, can induce anti-tumor immune responses (Cullin et al., 2021). Specific dietary fibers, notably pectin, have been shown to beneficially modify the gut microbiota composition and structure, leading to improved anti-PD-1 mAb efficacy in preclinical models (Zhang et al., 2021). The production of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), particularly butyrate, by gut bacteria appears to play a role in modulating immune responses and potentially enhancing anti-PD-1 therapy effectiveness, as observed in studies using mice and humanized microbiome models (Huang et al., 2022; Zhang et al., 2021). Certain bacterial taxa, including Akkermansia, Faecalibacterium, Lachnospiraceae, and Bifidobacterium, have been associated with improved responses to anti-PD-1 immunotherapy in various preclinical studies (Zhang et al., 2021; Stein-Thoeringer et al., 2023). The specific role of SCFAs in modulating anti-PD-1 efficacy remains complex, with conflicting findings regarding high levels of SCFAs in human patients (Hayase and Jenq, 2021). These findings suggest that dietary interventions targeting the gut microbiome composition and SCFA production could be explored as potential strategies to optimize anti-PD-1 immunotherapy responsiveness.

**Probiotic Supplementation**

Probiotic supplementation has been investigated for its potential to modulate the gut microbiome and enhance the efficacy of anti-PD-1 immunotherapy. Evidence suggests that certain probiotic strains, particularly Bifidobacterium species, can enhance CD8 + T cell-induced antitumor activity in preclinical models (Dzutsev et al., 2017; Cullin et al., 2021). Conversely, clinical studies have reported limited or no significant effects of probiotic supplementation on immunosuppression in cancer patients, and some studies even noted increased infection rates (Cullin et al., 2021). Specific probiotic strains, such as C. butyricum, have been shown to potentially enhance the efficacy of ICB in certain cancer patient populations (Tomita et al., 2022). The presence of viable probiotics within the tumor microenvironment has been demonstrated in preclinical models, suggesting that the bacteria themselves may be necessary


## 6. Data Quality & Interpretive Limitations

Microbiome composition is highly individual and dynamic; this report reflects a single time-point sample. Associations between microbiome features and immunotherapy response are derived from cohort-level studies and may not predict individual outcomes. The evidence base is evolving; findings should be interpreted in the context of current clinical judgment.

The patient's metagenomic sequencing data was generated using shotgun sequencing on an Illumina NovaSeq platform, yielding approximately 12 million reads. The data quality is considered moderate, indicating potential limitations in sequence accuracy and completeness. The sample was collected during an active antibiotic treatment phase, which may have reduced microbial diversity compared to a baseline state. Additionally, the data lacks metabolite information, specifically concerning tryptophan metabolites.
