MICROBIOME ANALYSIS - SUBOPTIMAL BUT MODIFIABLE
================================================================================
Sample Date: February 5, 2026 (33 days before planned CAR-T infusion)
Method: Shotgun metagenomic sequencing (Illumina NovaSeq, 12M reads)
Lab: Precision Microbiome Diagnostics

CLINICAL CONTEXT:
- On prophylactic levofloxacin × 14 days at sampling
- Recent piperacillin-tazobactam 49 days prior
- Multiple prior chemotherapy regimens
- Immunosuppressed (lymphopenia, post-R-CHOP/R-ICE)

DIVERSITY (LOW-MODERATE - SUBOPTIMAL):
- Shannon Index: 2.7 [LOW - risk for poor CAR-T outcomes]
- Simpson Index: 0.82
- Observed Species: 164 (reduced)
- Interpretation: Reduced diversity from antibiotics + chemotherapy

COMPOSITION:
Firmicutes 46.2% | Bacteroidetes 38.8% | Proteobacteria 8.4% ↑ | Actinobacteria 4.2%
F/B Ratio: 1.19 (low - dysbiosis)

KEY TAXA (% relative abundance):

FAVORABLE (present but suboptimal):
  - Akkermansia muciniphila: 1.8% [BORDERLINE - reduced]
  - Faecalibacterium prausnitzii: 3.6% [LOW - key SCFA producer depleted]
  - Ruminococcaceae: 9.2% [REDUCED]
  - Ruminococcus lactaris: 1.8% [CAR-T biomarker - Smith 2022]
  - Lachnospiraceae: 8.8% [REDUCED]
  - Lachnospira pectinoschiza: 1.2% [CAR-T favorable - Stein-Thoeringer]
  - Roseburia: 1.8%
  - Bifidobacterium spp.: 2.2% total [LOW]
  - Bacteroides eggerthii: 2.4% [CAR-T response predictor]

CONCERNING (elevated):
 - Proteobacteria: 8.4% [ELEVATED - dysbiosis marker]
 -  E. coli: 4.2% [ELEVATED - antibiotic selection]
 -  Klebsiella pneumoniae: 1.8% [ELEVATED]
 -  Enterococcus faecalis: 2.1% [ELEVATED - pathobiont]
 -  Bacteroides uniformis: 3.6% [CRS risk - Stein-Thoeringer 2023]
 -  Blautia spp.: 4.2% [High Blautia → worse CAR-T outcomes]
 -  Bacteroides ovatus: 4.8%

METABOLITES (Measured):

SCFAs (GC-MS):
 - Butyrate: 15.8 μM [LOW - CRITICAL for CD8+ T-cell function]
 - Propionate: 11.2 μM [LOW-MODERATE]
 - Acetate: 38.4 μM [MODERATE]
 - Total SCFA: 71.0 μM [LOW - suboptimal for T-cell support]

Interpretation: REDUCED SCFA production is a major concern. Butyrate is critical
for CAR-T cell cytotoxicity. Low levels correlate with reduced Faecalibacterium.

Bile Acids (LC-MS/MS):
 - Secondary bile acids: 18.2 μM [LOW]
 - Secondary/Primary: 0.81 [LOW - reduced microbial conversion]

Tryptophan Metabolites (LC-MS/MS):
- NOT DETECTED - pathway significantly disrupted

FUNCTIONAL PATHWAYS:
 - SCFA biosynthesis: 2.8% [SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED]
 - Butyrate production: 1.2% [CRITICALLY LOW]
 - Vitamin B synthesis: 2.1% [REDUCED]
 - LPS biosynthesis: 2.8% [ELEVATED - inflammation risk]
 - Antibiotic resistance genes: Detected (fluoroquinolone markers)

CLINICAL INTERPRETATION FOR CAR-T:

OVERALL: SUBOPTIMAL BUT MODIFIABLE (33-day intervention window)

MAJOR CONCERNS (worse CAR-T outcomes in literature):
1. LOW diversity (2.7) - Smith 2022: associated with worse response
2. LOW butyrate (15.8 μM) - Luu 2021: critical for CD8+ T-cell cytotoxicity
3. REDUCED Faecalibacterium (3.6%) - key SCFA producer depleted
4. ACTIVE fluoroquinolone - Prasad 2024: ongoing disruption
5. ELEVATED Proteobacteria (8.4%) - dysbiosis/inflammation
6. ELEVATED Bacteroides uniformis (3.6%) - CRS risk marker
7. High Blautia (4.2%) - associated with worse outcomes

FAVORABLE ASPECTS:
 - Akkermansia present (1.8%) - not completely depleted
 - Ruminococcus lactaris present (1.8%) - CAR-T biomarker
 - Bacteroides eggerthii present (2.4%) - response predictor
 - NO PPI use - not adding dysbiosis
 - 33 DAYS until CAR-T - TIME TO INTERVENE

CRS RISK (microbiome-based): MODERATE-HIGH
- Low diversity, elevated B. uniformis/Blautia, pro-inflammatory dysbiosis

NEUROTOXICITY RISK: MODERATE
- Low SCFA (neuroprotective effects diminished)

================================================================================
URGENT RECOMMENDATIONS (33-Day Optimization Window):

1.  DISCONTINUE LEVOFLOXACIN (consult ID)
   - Ongoing fluoroquinolone perpetuating dysbiosis
   - Risk/Benefit: Infection risk vs CAR-T efficacy

2. HIGH-DOSE PROBIOTICS (start immediately):
   - Multi-strain: Lactobacillus + Bifidobacterium
   - Example: Visbiome 900B CFU BID
   - Rationale: Restore beneficial bacteria

3. BUTYRATE ENHANCEMENT (critical):
   - Clostridium butyricum 2B CFU daily
   - High-fiber diet (25-30g/day)
   - Resistant starch 20g/day
   - Target: Restore butyrate before CAR-T

4. DIETARY INTERVENTION (nutritionist consult):
   - High-fiber, plant-based foods
   - Prebiotics: Inulin, pectin, resistant starch
   - Fermented foods: Yogurt, kefir (if ANC >1.5)

5. REPEAT MICROBIOME (March 1, 2026):
   - 1 week before lymphodepletion
   - Goal: Shannon >3.0, Butyrate >25 μM
   - Consider FMT if persistent dysbiosis

6. CONSIDER FMT:
   - If repeat shows persistent severe dysbiosis
   - Timing: ≥1 week before lymphodepletion

DATA QUALITY:
- Sample integrity: Good, adequate depth
- Limitations: Single time-point during active antibiotics
- Context: Results reflect antibiotic-disrupted state

================================================================================

ASSESSMENT & PLAN:

60yo male with R/R DLBCL (stage IV, BM+) post R-CHOP/R-ICE, planned for CD19
CAR-T (axicabtagene ciloleucel) on March 10, 2026.

CAR-T CANDIDACY: ✓ APPROVED
- CD19+ disease, no contraindications
- ECOG 2 acceptable, cardiac/CNS cleared

MICROBIOME: SUBOPTIMAL BUT MODIFIABLE
- Active antibiotic dysbiosis
- LOW butyrate → CD8+ T-cell concern
- Moderate-high CRS risk based on microbiome
- 33-day intervention window

PLAN:

1. LEUKAPHERESIS: February 14, 2026

2. MICROBIOME OPTIMIZATION (URGENT):
   A. ID Consult: Discontinue levofloxacin if safe
   B. Probiotics: Visbiome 900B CFU BID (start now)
   C. Butyrate: C. butyricum + resistant starch
   D. Diet: High-fiber (nutritionist Feb 10)
   E. Repeat microbiome: March 1 (pre-lymphodepletion)

3. LYMPHODEPLETION: March 7-9 (Flu/Cy)

4. CAR-T INFUSION: March 10 (Day 0)

5. POST-CAR-T MONITORING (high CRS/neurotoxicity risk):
   - ICU-level monitoring × 48hr
   - Daily neuro assessments (ICE score)
   - Tocilizumab/dexamethasone available bedside
   - CBC/CMP daily × 14 days

6. RESPONSE ASSESSMENT:
   - Day +30: PET-CT, MRD
   - Microbiome correlation at Days +30, +100

PROGNOSIS: Guardedly optimistic. CAR-T shows 50-60% durable CR in R/R DLBCL.
Microbiome optimization may improve outcomes and reduce toxicity.

FOLLOW-UP:
- Leukapheresis: Feb 14
- Nutritionist: Feb 10
- ID consult: Feb 9 (re: levofloxacin)
- Repeat microbiome: Mar 1
- Admission: Mar 7
