MICROBIOME ANALYSIS - HIGHLY FAVORABLE PROFILE
================================================================================
Sample Date: February 7, 2026
Method: Shotgun metagenomic sequencing (Illumina NovaSeq, 15M reads)
Lab: Precision Microbiome Diagnostics

DIVERSITY (HIGH - FAVORABLE):
- Shannon Index: 3.6 
- Simpson Index: 0.91 
- Observed Species: 247
- Interpretation: High diversity consistently associated with better ICI response

COMPOSITION:
Firmicutes 52.8% | Bacteroidetes 34.6% | Actinobacteria 8.2% | Proteobacteria 2.8%
F/B Ratio: 1.53 (balanced)

KEY TAXA (% relative abundance):

FAVORABLE BACTERIA (HIGH - excellent for anti-PD-1):
 - Akkermansia muciniphila: 4.8% [VERY HIGH - strongest NSCLC predictor]
 - Faecalibacterium prausnitzii: 8.9% [HIGH - SCFA producer]
 - Ruminococcaceae family: 14.2% [HIGH - favorable]
 - Bifidobacterium longum: 3.2% + B. adolescentis: 1.8% [FAVORABLE]
 - Lachnospiraceae family: 12.8% [HIGH]
 - Roseburia intestinalis: 3.8% [butyrate producer]
 - Alistipes putredinis: 2.6% [favorable in NSCLC]
 - Prevotella copri: 4.2%

LESS FAVORABLE (LOW - good):
- Bacteroides spp.: 11.3% total (moderate)
- E. coli: 1.2%, Enterococcus: 0.4%, Fusobacterium: <0.1% (all low - favorable)

METABOLITES (Measured):

SCFAs (GC-MS):
 - Butyrate: 32.8 μM [HIGH - excellent for CD8+ T cells]
 - Propionate: 18.6 μM
 - Acetate: 58.4 μM
 - Total SCFA: 118.0 μM [HIGH]

Bile Acids (LC-MS/MS):
- Secondary bile acids: 42.8 μM (high conversion - favorable)
- Secondary/Primary ratio: 2.33

Tryptophan Metabolites (LC-MS/MS):
- Indole: 5.2 μM [AhR ligand]
- Indole-3-aldehyde: 2.8 μM
- Kynurenine/Tryptophan: 0.34 (moderate IDO activity)

Other:
- Inosine: 2.4 μM [T-cell activation]

FUNCTIONAL PATHWAYS:
- SCFA biosynthesis: HIGH
- Butyrate production: HIGH
- Vitamin B synthesis: HIGH
- Bile salt hydrolase: Moderate-High

CLINICAL INTERPRETATION:

OVERALL: HIGHLY FAVORABLE PROFILE FOR PEMBROLIZUMAB

Strengths:
1.  Very high diversity (Shannon 3.6) - predicts ICI response
2.  VERY HIGH Akkermansia (4.8%) - strongest predictor in NSCLC (Routy/Derosa)
3.  High Faecalibacterium (8.9%) - responder taxon
4.  High Ruminococcaceae (14.2%) - favorable in multiple ICI studies
5.  Robust SCFA production - supports CD8+ T-cell function
6.  Plant-based diet correlation with favorable microbiome
7.  No PPI use - microbiome not disrupted
8.  Full antibiotic recovery (49 days post-levofloxacin)

Literature Alignment:
- Routy 2018: Akkermansia >1% favorable → Patient: 4.8% 
- Gopalakrishnan 2018: High diversity favorable → Patient: High 
- Derosa 2022: Akkermansia predicts NSCLC response → Patient: Very high 

Predicted Response: FAVORABLE microbiome signature for pembrolizumab in NSCLC.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Continue high-fiber, plant-based diet
2. Avoid antibiotics during treatment if possible
3. Maintain PPI-free status
4. Repeat microbiome at Week 12 with response assessment

================================================================================
ASSESSMENT & PLAN:

66yo never-smoker with stage IVA lung adenocarcinoma (high PD-L1 65%, high TMB 18)
initiating first-line pembrolizumab monotherapy.

FAVORABLE FACTORS:
- High PD-L1 (65%), High TMB (18)
- HIGHLY FAVORABLE microbiome (high diversity, very high Akkermansia, high butyrate)
- Good performance status (ECOG 1)
- No PPI use, full antibiotic recovery

PLAN:
1. Pembrolizumab 200mg IV Q3W starting Feb 19, 2026
2. Monitor for irAEs (pneumonitis risk given lung disease)
3. Continue plant-based high-fiber diet
4. Repeat CT at Week 12 (May 2026)
5. Repeat microbiome at Week 12 to correlate with response

PROGNOSIS: Guardedly optimistic given favorable biomarkers and microbiome profile.
